using UnityEngine;

public class CreateRecoveryExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Client client;
    private Account account;

    async void Start()
    {
        client = new Client()
            .SetEndpoint("https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1") // Your API Endpoint
            .SetProject("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>"); // Your project ID

        account = new Account(client);

        await ExampleCreateRecovery();
    }
    
    async UniTask ExampleCreateRecovery()
    {
        try
        {
            Token result = await account.CreateRecovery(
                email: "email@example.com",
                url: "https://example.com"
            );
            Debug.Log("Success: " + result);
        }
        catch (AppwriteException ex)
        {
            Debug.LogError($"Error: {ex.Message} (Code: {ex.Code})");
        }
    }
}
```

## Parameters

- **email** *string* - User email. *(required)* 
- **url** *string* - URL to redirect the user back to your app from the recovery email. Only URLs from hostnames in your project platform list are allowed. This requirement helps to prevent an [open redirect](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html) attack against your project API. *(required)* 

## Response

Returns `Token` object.
## More Info

Sends the user an email with a temporary secret key for password reset. When the user clicks the confirmation link he is redirected back to your app password reset URL with the secret key and email address values attached to the URL query string. Use the query string params to submit a request to the [PUT /account/recovery](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#updateRecovery) endpoint to complete the process. The verification link sent to the user&#039;s email address is valid for 1 hour.
