## Parameters

- **userId** *string* - User ID. Choose a custom ID or generate a random ID with `ID.unique()`. Valid chars are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period, hyphen, and underscore. Can&#039;t start with a special char. Max length is 36 chars. If the email address has never been used, a new account is created using the provided userId. Otherwise, if the email address is already attached to an account, the user ID is ignored. *(required)* 
- **email** *string* - User email. *(required)* 
- **phrase** *boolean* - Toggle for security phrase. If enabled, email will be send with a randomly generated phrase and the phrase will also be included in the response. Confirming phrases match increases the security of your authentication flow. *(optional)*

## Response

Returns `Token` object.
## More Info

Sends the user an email with a secret key for creating a session. If the email address has never been used, a **new account is created** using the provided `userId`. Otherwise, if the email address is already attached to an account, the **user ID is ignored**. Then, the user will receive an email with the one-time password. Use the returned user ID and secret and submit a request to the [POST /v1/account/sessions/token](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#createSession) endpoint to complete the login process. The secret sent to the user&#039;s email is valid for 15 minutes.

A user is limited to 10 active sessions at a time by default. [Learn more about session limits](https://appwrite.io/docs/authentication-security#limits).
